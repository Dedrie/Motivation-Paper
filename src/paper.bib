### A Motivational Model of Video Game Engagement
Postulates an empirical model based on SDT. Video games can increase intrinsic motivation an short term well being
by providing players with experiences that satisfy SDT.
review: Autonomy and competence need satisfaction translates to greater game enjoyment, greater self esteem and an increased chance of replay.
The popularity of a game was related to variability in need satisfaction, autonomy. Satisfying experiences of play predicts motivation and well being
across different games. Autonomy and need satisfaction accounts for increased game enjoyment for violent games, and differences in aggression was
correlated with preferences for future play, but not of increased enjoyment. Violent content does not contribute to the appeal.
